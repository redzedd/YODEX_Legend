We plan to expand our collection with more Stylized assets in the future. To simplify the process, we've created the 'Stylized Pack - Common’ folder, where all shared files are stored in one place. This will enable us to reuse shaders, functions, and scripts, ensuring a unified ecosystem for all the stylized assets we’ll release.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to use ASP Global System:
1) Drag and drop the ASP Global Settings prefab in your scene.
2) Play with the settings.

Important:
- Keep an ASP Global Settings prefab in each scene. When creating a new scene, make sure to include the ASP Global prefab.
- Use only one ASP Global Settings prefab per scene. Multiple ASP prefabs are not supported.
- ASP Global System works exclusively with Stylized Packs by ANGRY MESH.
