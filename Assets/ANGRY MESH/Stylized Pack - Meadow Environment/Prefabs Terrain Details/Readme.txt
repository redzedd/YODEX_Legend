Unity's Terrain system doesn't support LODs for objects placed with Paint Details (such as flowers, grass, or rocks). Therefore, we created an additional prefab folder called 'Prefabs Terrain Details,' containing only the prefabs compatible with the Paint Details system.

If you're using other tools for placing vegetation that support LODs, you can ignore/remove the Prefabs Terrain Details folder.
